[![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/badoualy/kotlogram.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#badoualy/kotlogram)
===========
> **Easy to use** and **straightforward** Kotlin (and Java) binding of [Telegram API](https://core.telegram.org/api).
> The project is coded in **Kotlin**, with some classes (mostly generated and legacy classes) in Java
> The Java code will be replaced by Kotlin over time

> **Kotlin, what is that, I don't know this language!** 
> Don't worry, Kotlin is a JVM language just like Java and Scala, and is interoperable with Java! You can use this as a standard Java Library

Beta
----------------
The project is still in beta, a lot is yet to be done. It comes with absolutely no warranty!
Main tasks left:
- Implement [Perfect Forward Secrecy](https://core.telegram.org/api/pfs).
- Improve error handling for the requests, and the exceptions in the mtproto module.
- Implement tests

Known Bugs
----------------
- createChannel method always seems to fail, the issue is either with the tl-schema (got it from official web app) or with Telegram blocking this feature for non-official apps

Usage
----------------
#### Dependency

First, add [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/) to your project if that's not already the case, in your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
repositories {
    // ...
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```

Then add the library dependency:
```gradle
compile 'com.github.badoualy:kotlogram:0.0.5'
```

### Be warned
Telegram has yet to update the documentation (currently stopped at layer 18, using layer 45), but I **will not document all the features myself**. So please, restrain from opening ticket to ask "How can I send a sticker", "How can I create a group". You can either try to look at the old documentation or the source of official applications and figure it out yourself, I won't be doing Telegram's job nor yours. Kotlogram is just here to provide a binding of the API, not a documentation.

However, I will supply a simple example on how to use the library itself to call rpc methods.

#### Example
You need to implement your own C class holding all the constants, it's not included in the repository since it contains confidential information such as my phone number, api id, ...
```java
// Activate debug log or not, false by default
// Kotlogram.setDebugLogEnabled(true);

// Replace the following constants with your app's information
// This informations are used in initConnection and sendCode rpc methods
TelegramApp app = new TelegramApp(C.API_ID, C.API_HASH, C.MODEL, C.SYSTEM_VERSION, C.APP_VERSION, C.LANG_CODE);

// This is a synchronous client, that will block until the response arrive (or until timeout)
// A client which return an Observable<T> where T is the response type will be available soon
// TelegramClient interface contains 1 method for each RPC method described in the TL-Schema,
// and some more convenience methods (like to download a UserPhoto)
TelegramClient client = Kotlogram.getDefaultClient(app, new ApiStorage());

// You can start making requests
try {
    // Send code to account
    TLAbsSentCode sentCode = client.authSendCode(C.PHONE_NUMBER, 5);
    System.out.println("Authentication code: ");
    String code = new Scanner(System.in).nextLine();

    // Auth with the received code
    TLAuthorization authorization = client.authSignIn(C.PHONE_NUMBER, sentCode.getPhoneCodeHash(), code);
    TLUser self = authorization.getUser().getAsUser();
    System.out.println("You are now signed in as " + self.getFirstName() + " " + self.getLastName());

    // Start making cool stuff!
    // Get a list of 10 most recent conversations
    TLAbsDialogs dialogs = client.messagesGetDialogs(0, 0, new TLInputPeerEmpty(), 10);
    for (TLAbsMessage message : dialogs.getMessages()) {
if (message instanceof TLMessage) {
    System.out.println("Found message " + ((TLMessage) message).getMessage());
} else {
    System.out.println("Found a service message or empty message");
}
    }

    // Take the first user in the list, and send a message to him
    // It'll probably be Telegram bot, since he'll send you the code
    TLUser randomUser = dialogs.getUsers().get(0).getAsUser();
    TLInputPeerUser inputUser = new TLInputPeerUser(randomUser.getId(), randomUser.getAccessHash());
    int randomId = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis()).nextInt();
    client.messagesSendMessage(false, false, inputUser, 0, "Kotlogram is awesome!", randomId, null, null);
    System.out.println("Message sent");
} catch (RpcErrorException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    client.close(); // Important, do not forget this, or your process won't finish
}
System.out.println("------------------------- GOOD BYE");
```


Structure
----------------
The project is composed by the following modules:
- [tl-builder: Type Language compiler](#tl-builder-type-language-compiler)
- [tl: Type Language library](#tl-type-language-library)
- [mtproto: MTProto Mobile Protocol library](#mtproto-mtproto-mobile-protocol-implementation)
- [api](#api)


tl-builder: [Type Language](http://core.telegram.org/mtproto/TL) compiler
----------------
Converts json-representation of [TL Schema](http://core.telegram.org/schema) to Java classes with generated classes for serializing and deserializing api messages and methods to their binary representation (see [Binary Data Serialization](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/serialize)).
Used JavaPoet to generate the classes.
#### Usage
1. Run the main class in tl-builder module with the layer value

The classes will be generated in the ```tl``` module in the package ```com.github.badoualy.telegram.tl.api```.


tl: [Type Language]() library
----------------
Contains the base type of the Type Language (int, long, Vecor, ...) and the classes generated by the ```tl-builder```. This module is the lowest level in the library, it supplies all the necessary classes to serialize/deserialize objects describe in the [TL Schema](https://core.telegram.org/schema).
#### About TL Language
"*TL Language (Type Language or Time Limit) serves to describe the used system of types, constructors, and existing functions. In fact, the combinator description format presented in Binary Data Serialization is used.*"


mtproto: [MTProto Mobile Protocol](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) library
----------------
Contains all the necessary stuff to make RPC (Remote Procedure Call) and handle all the low-level stuff (like handling salt, etc.)
#### About MTProto..

**MTProto** is the [Telegram Messenger](http://www.telegram.org ) protocol 
_"designed for access to a server API from applications running on mobile devices"_.

The Mobile Protocol is subdivided into three components ([from the official site](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto#general-description)):

 - High-level component (API query language): defines the method whereby API 
 queries and responses are converted to binary messages.
 
 - Cryptographic (authorization) layer: defines the method by which messages 
 are encrypted prior to being transmitted through the transport protocol.      
 
 - Transport component: defines the method for the client and the server to transmit 
 messages over some other existing network protocol (such as, http, https, tcp, udp).


api
----------------
High-level API to easily use Telegram's [api methods](https://core.telegram.org/methods) without having to understand the first thing about MTProto or TL Language :)
An old fashioned Java API (like using [RestFB](https://github.com/restfb/restfb) or a any Rest API binding)
